Below is a summary of the work done, along with links to each project repository.

## AI & Machine Learning
- **[Lung Cancer Classification](https://github.com/pazzolini/lung-cancer-classification)**
  - 📖 Context: Developed for the _Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science_ course (2024/25), utilizing Python libraries and Jupyter Notebook.
  - 🛠 Summary: Machine learning models for lung cancer classification using CT scan data. Feature selection techniques include LASSO and Random Forest. Classifiers tested: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
  - 👥 Collaborators: @Alejandro-131004, @Mihalachee, @Jony700.
 
- **[Wine Database API](https://github.com/pazzolini/wine-db)**
  - 📖 Context: Individual project for the _Database Systems_ (2023/24), utilizing SQL and Python.
  - 🛠 Summary: Designed and implemented a relational database for wine data, encompassing user reviews and wine characteristics. Developed a Python API to facilitate interaction with the database, enabling retrieval of detailed wine-related information.
  - 👥 Collaborators: Solo project.  

- **[Portuguese Wine Analysis](https://github.com/pazzolini/portuguese-wine-vivino)**
  - 📖 Context: Individual project for the _Elements of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science course_ (2022/23), utilizing Python libraries and Jupyter Notebook.
  - 🛠 Summary: Analyzed Portuguese wines using data scraped from Vivino. Tasks included data cleaning, exploration, and machine learning classification to predict wine ratings based on features like price, region, and type.
  - 👥 Collaborators: Solo project.

- **[Mancala](https://github.com/pazzolini/mancala)**
  - 📖 Context: Individual project for the _Elements of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science course_ (2022/23), utilizing Python.
